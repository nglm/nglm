# Hi! I'm Natacha Galmiche, a PhD candidate in Machine Learning!

### About me

I am currently **a PhD candidate in the [machine learning group](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/ml/130730/machine-learning-group)** of the University of Bergen (Norway). Before that, **I studied mathematics and computer science** in Toulouse (France), with 2 complementary master's programs in High-Performance Computing, Big Data and Machine Learning. **My preferred programming language is python**, but I also did some development for example in javascript for a web-based application.

On my GitHub profile, you can see most of **my research and teaching projects**.

### Research

My main PhD project aims at **clustering time-series data in the context of ensemble weather prediction**. From there, I became more and more interested in research questions related to clustering in general, notably **taking into account the uncertainty on the number of clusters** ([PersiGraph](https://github.com/nglm/persigraph) and [GraphApp](https://github.com/nglm/graphapp)), **cluster validity indices** (**[PyCVI](https://github.com/nglm/pycvi)** and [ClusterExp](https://github.com/nglm/clusterexp)) as well as the impact of different distance metrics on the training and evaluation of machine learning models.

While doing an internship at the Nansen Center in Bergen (Norway) in 2019, I also carried out research on machine learning applied to ocean inverse problems, using **Self-Organising Maps and Hidden Markov Models** to infer subsurface data from surface data ([SubMAPP](https://github.com/nglm/submapp)).

### Teaching

During my PhD, I have been lucky enough to be a **teaching assistant in 2 machine learning courses**, INF264: Introduction to Machine Learning ([INF264](https://github.com/nglm/inf264) and [Python Crash Course](https://github.com/nglm/python-crash-course)) and INF265: Deep Learning ([INF265](https://github.com/nglm/inf265) and [PyTorch Tutorials](https://github.com/nglm/pytorch-tutorials)). There, I was responsible for the practical part of the courses and could then **design many exercises (with solutions) and tutorials**.

In addition, I have been a **lecturer / course coordinator in introductory courses in programming and python**, DIGI611: Algoritmer og programmering ([DIGI611](https://github.com/nglm/digi611), note: resources in Norwegian).
